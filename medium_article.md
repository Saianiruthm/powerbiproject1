# Microsoft AdventureWorks Database Analysis and Visualization with PowerBI

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis and visualization of the AdventureWorks database utilizing Microsoft Power BI. The analysis primarily focuses on the AdventureWorksLT2019.bak and AdventureWorksLT2017.bak datasets. The data exploration involves query editing within Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and visualization through Microsoft Power BI. Additionally, MS Excel and Power BI's query tool are utilized for thorough analysis.

## Data Source
The selected datasets, AdventureWorksLT2019.bak and AdventureWorksLT2017.bak, originate from the AdventureWorks sample database. These datasets were restored from the "AdventureWorksDW2019" database and specifically leverage the following tables for analysis:

- `Dim_Customer.sql`
- `Dim_Products.sql`
- `Dim_Date.sql`
- `FactInternetSales.sql`
